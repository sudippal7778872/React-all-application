now we will minimize our code:

here we will use spread operator and object braket property.
setValue((previousValue))
--> here previous value contain the previous property. so we can use that use spread operator.
--> then we will update the value with that property which name attribute is same with value. like below
name:value ----it will create a new property if the name attribute value is not matching. here name is string to make name
as variable we have to use object's braket propert.
[name]:value  --- now the name is variable.

---> match all the name attribute value with useState({})'s object's key. both will be same.
