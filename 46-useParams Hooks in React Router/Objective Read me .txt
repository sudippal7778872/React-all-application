useParam

this hook is used to route dynamically

here we are trying to create dynamic root in user.

http://localhost:3000/user/anything
after "/user" if anyone type anything we will show a welcome page. with that anything.

for example:
1. if user type http://localhost:3000/user/suman
==> wecome suman

2. if user type http://localhost:3000/user/sudip
==> wecome sudip
